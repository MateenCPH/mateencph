## 🙋‍♂️ About me

![profile view count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=mateencph)

I'm from Denmark, currently living in Copenhagen. I'm a huge fan of Java, JavaScript, open-source, and writing testable software 💻. When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, I can be found playing football ⚽, lifting weights 🏋️, boxing 🥊, and spending quality time with family and friends ❤️

## 🔭 I'm currently working on
